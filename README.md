# Weather App üå§Ô∏è

A simple weather app that provides real-time weather information for cities, including a 5-day forecast. This app fetches data from a weather API and allows users to track weather in multiple locations. It also saves a history of searched cities in a local JSON file.

## Features

- Get current weather details (temperature, wind speed, humidity, etc.) for any city.
- View a 5-day weather forecast.
- Store and manage a history of previously searched cities.
- Lightweight, modular architecture using TypeScript and Node.js.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js** and **TypeScript** for backend services.
- **node-fetch** for making HTTP requests.
- **dotenv** for environment variable management.
- **UUID** for generating unique city identifiers.
- **fs/promises** for file system operations.
